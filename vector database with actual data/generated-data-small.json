The beam-line shielding and the expected radiation levels are presented in chapter 3. This is followed, in chapters 4, 5, and 6, by the description of the inner detector, calorimetry, and muon spectrometer, respectively. The forward detectors, not shown in figure 1.1, are discussed in chapter 7. Chapter 8 outlines the hardware aspects of the trigger and data acquisition systems. Chapter 9 then presents the main features of the infrastructure in the ATLAS cavern, including the overall integration of the experiment, the sub-detector positioning strategy and the corresponding survey results, the services (including cables, pipes, gas and cooling systems, cryogenics, back-up power infrastructure, etc.), the beam-pipe, and the access and maintenance scenarios. Chapter 10 presents an overview of the global performance expected from the ATLAS detector, as obtained from combined test-beam measurements and from the latest analysis results based on the large-scale simulations done for the commissioning of the computing system. Finally, chapter 11 briefly summarises the current status of installation and commissioning, and the expectations for the ultimate completion of the detector and its operation.\n",

It is designed to provide a 2 T axial field (1.998 T at the magnet's centre at the nominal 7.730 kA operational current). To achieve the desired calorimeter performance, the layout was carefully optimised to keep the material thickness in front of the calorimeter as low as possible, resulting in the solenoid assembly contributing a total of \\(\\sim\\) 0.66 radiation lengths [9] at normal incidence. This required, in particular, that the solenoid windings and LAr calorimeter share a common vacuum vessel, thereby eliminating two vacuum walls. An additional heat shield consisting of 2 mm thick aluminium panels is installed between the solenoid and the inner wall of the cryostat. The single-layer coil is wound with a high-strength Al-stabilised NbTi conductor, specially developed to achieve a high field while optimising thickness, inside a 12 mm thick Al 5083 support cylinder. The inner and outer diameters of the solenoid are 2.46 m and 2.56 m and its axial length is 5.8 m. The coil mass is 5.4 tonnes and the stored energy is 40 MJ. The stored-energy-to-mass ratio of only 7.4 kJ/kg at nominal field [2] clearly demonstrates successful compliance with the design requirement of an extremely light-weight structure. The flux is returned by the steel of the ATLAS hadronic calorimeter and its girder structure (see figure 2.1). The solenoid is charged and discharged in about 30 minutes. In the case of a quench, the stored energy is absorbed by the enthalpy of the cold mass which raises the cold mass temperature to a safe value of 120 K maximum.

In parallel, all coils successfully underwent on-surface acceptance test procedures [16]. Cool down and testing of the barrel toroid in the cavern took place in 2006. The cool down of the 360-tonne cold mass to 4.6 K takes five weeks. The test programme included normal ramps, up to nominal current (in 2 hours) followed by either a slow dump (in 2 hours) or a fast dump (in 2 minutes) in the case of a provoked quench. The ultimate test sequence that proved the system's health is shown in figure 2.4. The magnet current is raised in steps up to its nominal value of 20.5 kA and then finally up to 21.0 kA, demonstrating the ability of the system to withstand at least an additional 500 A. The current is then allowed to decay back to its design value; the magnet is finally turned off by a deliberate fast dump. After re-cooling the cycle was repeated, demonstrating that no degradation had occurred up to the nominal operating current. During a fast dump, triggered either manually or by the quench detection system, the stored energy of 1.1 GJ is absorbed by the enthalpy of the cold mass following the activation of four quench heaters per coil and in all eight coils, which forces the entire magnet into the normal conducting state within less than two seconds. This leads to a very safe global cold mass temperature of about 58 K and a hot-spot temperature in the windings of about 85 K maximum. The uniform quench heating system also ensures that the internal voltage in the toroid is kept at a low value of about 70 V. After a fast dump the magnet cooling system needs\n",

Two NMR probes, installed at low-gradient locations in the barrel toroid, complement the system, with the aim of detecting eventual long-term drifts in the response of the Hall cards. The 3-D sensor readings are compared with field calculations which include both the contributions of the magnet windings and those of nearby magnetised structures, and are used for reconstructing the position and the shape of the toroid conductors with respect to the muon chambers (see figure 2.12). Once the geometry of the coils is known, the field can be calculated anywhere in the muon spectrometer. Simulation studies using a simplified coil deformation model have shown that the magnetic field can be reconstructed to a relative accuracy of 0.2% [27].\n"

            "The field reconstruction algorithm outlined in section 2.2.3 and detailed in [27] has been applied to B-sensor data collected at nominal field in the barrel toroid. Because the muon alignment system was still being commissioned and the MDT survey not yet completed, it is necessary, at this stage, to assume that all muon chambers and B-sensors are in their nominal position. For the three coils bracketed by the available sensors, the reconstructed conductor shape is qualitatively consistent with that measured at room temperature before insertion of the windings into their respective cryostats. Figure 2.14 displays the difference, at each active sensor in sector 2 (see figure 6.1) of the muon spectrometer, between the azimuthal component of the measured field (corrected for perturbations from magnetic materials) and that of the Biot-Savart contribution predicted by the field-reconstruction fit. A perfect description of the conductor geometry and of magnetic perturbations should yield \\(\\Delta\\mathrm{B}_{\\phi}=0\\). The agreement is best in the middle chambers (BM), where the gradients are smallest: the distribution is well centred and exhibits a spread \\(\\Delta\\mathrm{B}_{\\phi}^{RMS}\\sim 1.2\\) mT. In the outer chamber layer (BOS), the distribution of \\(\\Delta\\)\\(\\mathrm{B}_{\\phi}\\) shows a moderate bias of \\(2.2\\) mT and a spread of \\(2.6\\) mT. In view of the larger field gradient in these chambers, such a spread is consistent with the current \\(\\pm 5\\) mm uncertainty on the as-installed MDT chamber positions. The situation is similar but somewhat worse in the inner chambers (BIS). These preliminary results reflect the cumulative effect of errors in the assumed sensor and chamber geometry, of residual imperfections in the magnetic model of the calorimeter steel, and of the performance of the reconstruction fit.\n"

            "In ATLAS, most of the energy from the primary particles is dumped into two regions: the Target Absorber Secondaries (TAS) collimators, and the Forward Calorimeters (FCal) depicted in figure 3.1, which are therefore among the strongest sources of secondary radiation. These two sources are somewhat self-shielding, and since they are compact, they have been further shielded with layers of dense material and cladding. The beam-vacuum system, on the other hand, spans the whole length of the detector. In the forward regions, it is another major source of radiation background due to interactions of primary particles which strike the beam-pipe at very shallow angles. Through this mechanism, the beam-pipe becomes an extended line source illuminating the interior of the forward cavity. Detailed studies have shown that the beam-line material is responsible for more than half of the fluences expected in the muon system [34].\n",
            "Very large reductions in the expected background rates in the muon spectrometer have been achieved by designing a large amount of shielding around the TAS. A total shielding weight of 2825 tonnes (1887 tonnes of metal, 920 tonnes of concrete, and 18 tonnes of plastic) has thus been added to the detector. Since different types of radiation are best stopped with different types of shielding materials, a multi-layered shielding approach has been used. The inner layer's purpose is to stop high-energy hadrons and their secondaries. This layer is made of materials such as iron or copper, which provide a large number of interaction lengths. In the case of iron, studies have shown that a minimum carbon content of a few percent is advantageous since it efficiently moderates the neutron energies down to lower values. A second layer, consisting of boron-doped polyethylene, is used to moderate the neutron radiation escaping from the first layer and the low-energy neutrons are then captured by the dopant. Photon radiation is created in the neutron-capture process and these photons are stopped in the third shielding layer which consists of steel or lead. Lead is more effective in stopping photons, but induces more neutron radiation than steel. Figure 3.1 shows the locations of the different shielding components in ATLAS.\n",

            "The Cerenkov light emitted by a particle traversing the tube has a half-angle of 3\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and is reflected on average three times before the light is measured by photomultiplier tubes (PMT's) which match the size of the Cerenkov tubes. The signal amplitude from these PMT's can be used to distinguish the number of particles per tube, and the fast timing response provides unambiguous measurements of individual bunch-crossings. LUCID is situated in a high radiation area and, although the PMT's have quartz windows and are radiation hard, their performance is expected to degrade after several years of operation at nominal LHC luminosity. It is therefore foreseen to upgrade the detector after some years of operation. The Cerenkov light from the upgraded detector could be transmitted through radiation-hard quartz fibres to a region outside the forward shielding (see figure 3.1) with a low level of background radiation, in which the fibres would be read out with multi-anode PMT's. In this readout scheme, a Winston cone at the end of each Cerenkov tube focuses the light onto a bundle of 37 fused silica fibres with 0.8 mm diameter. A Winston cone is a parabola of revolution profile designed to maximise the collection of incoming rays. In order to gain experience with this type of readout, four of the twenty Cerenkov tubes are read out by fibres in this manner. The initial LUCID detector will not have a re-circulating gas system as it is not expected to be needed for the low-luminosity phase of the LHC. However, such a system could be envisaged for high-luminosity operations, should it prove to be necessary.\n"

The bulk of this shielding disk consists of a vertical steel disk with a diameter of 872 cm. This disk supports end-cap muon trigger chambers (see section 6.8). At the centre of the disk and surrounding the beam-pipe is a stainless steel tube containing a set of cylindrical shielding pieces made of leaded red brass (85% Cu, 5% Pb, 5% Sn, 5% Zn). This tube also supports Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) and Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT). Brass shielding has been added to the disk in order to protect the CSC chambers.

These shielding elements, which are removable and will be stored in the surface building during maintenance of ATLAS, consist of two parts: a cylindrical core and a set of octagonal pieces in the rear. All pieces are made of cast ductile iron, surrounded by a layer of polyethylene doped with boron in the form of H\\({}_{3}\\)BO\\({}_{3}\\) and followed by a 3 cm thick steel layer.

The nose shielding is permanently installed in ATLAS and, unlike the forward shielding assemblies, cannot be removed during shutdowns. The main component of this shielding is the cylindrical 117 tonne heavy \"monobloc\", which has an outer diameter of 295 cm. It is made of cast iron and supported by a tube, which is anchored in a 460 tonne concrete structure.

This performance has been studied extensively over the years [60], both before and after irradiation of production modules, and also, more recently, during the combined test beam (CTB) runs in 2004 as described in section 10.1, and in a series of cosmic-ray tests in 2006 as described in section 4.9.

Each vessel forms a cylindrical torus centred on the beam axis and the space in between the vessels is under vacuum. As described in section 2.1.1, the central solenoid is housed in the insulating vacuum of the barrel cryostat and supported by the inner cylinder of the warm barrel vessel. The two end-cap cryostats each house one electromagnetic end-cap calorimeter (EMEC), one hadronic end-cap calorimeter (HEC) and one forward calorimeter (FCal).
