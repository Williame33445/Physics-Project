Figure 1a, b show two examples of tree-level diagrams for \\(t\\bar{t}H\\) production with a subsequent \\(H\\to b\\bar{b}\\) decay. A search for the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top-quark pair using several Higgs decay modes (including \\(H\\to b\\bar{b}\\)) has recently been published by the CMS Collaboration [24] quoting a ratio of the measured \\(t\\bar{t}H\\) signal cross section to the SM expectation for a Higgs boson mass of 125.6 GeV  of \\(\\mu=2.8\\pm 1.0\\).",

        "The signal hypothesis is defined as a SM Higgs boson produced in association with a top-quark pair as shown in Fig. 1a, b.

For the background hypothesis, only the diagrams of the irreducible \\(t\\bar{t}\\)+\\(b\\bar{b}\\) background are considered. Since it dominates the most signal-rich analysis regions, inclusion of other processes does not improve the separation between signal and background. No gluon radiation from the final-state quarks is allowed, since these are kinematically suppressed and difficult to treat in any kinematic transformation aiming for phase-space alignment during the integration process. In the definition of the signal and background hypothesis the LO diagrams are required to have a top-quark pair as an intermediate state resulting in exactly four \\(b\\)-quarks, two light quarks, one charged lepton (electron or muon) and one neutrino in the final state.

        "Figure 19 demonstrates the effect of various systematic uncertainties on the fitted value of \\(\\mu\\) and the constraints provided by the data. The post-fit effect on \\(\\mu\\) is calculated by fixing the corresponding nuisance parameter at \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\pm\\sigma_{\\theta}\\), where \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is the fitted value of the nuisance parameter and \\(\\sigma_{\\theta}\\) is its post-fit uncertainty, and performing the fit again. The difference between the default and the modified \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\Delta\\mu\\), represents the effect on \\(\\mu\\) of this particular systematic uncertainty. The largest effect arises from the uncertainty in normalisation of the irreducible \\(t\\bar{t}+b\\bar{b}\\) background. This uncertainty is reduced by more than one half from the initial 50 %. The \\(t\\bar{t}+b\\bar{b}\\) background normalisation is pulled up by about 40 % in the fit, resulting in an increase in the observed \\(t\\bar{t}+b\\bar{b}\\) yield with respect to the Powheg+Pythia prediction. Most of the reduction in uncertainty on the \\(t\\bar{t}+b\\bar{b}\\) normalisation is the result of the significant number of data events in the signal-rich regions dominated by \\(t\\bar{t}+b\\bar{b}\\) background. With no Gaussian prior considered on the \\(t\\bar{t}+b\\bar{b}\\) normalisation, as described in Sect. 8, the fit still prefers an increase in the amount of \\(t\\bar{t}+b\\bar{b}\\) background by about 40 %.",

As mentioned earlier, given the lower sensitivity of the cuts-based approach, a more restrictive requirement is made on \\(H_{\\rm T}\\), namely \\(H_{\\rm T}>800\\) GeV, for the cuts-based signal region definition. Given the sizable background, particularly from \\(t\\bar{t}\\) events, that passes these requirements, simply comparing the total number of events in the signal region with the number expected from background processes would not be very sensitive. Instead, the cuts-based analysis exploits the fact that signal events tend to have higher values of \\(H_{\\rm T}\\) and \\(N_{\\rm V}\\) than do background events, as shown in Fig. 1. The cuts-based SR data are divided into two exclusive subcategories, one with \\(N_{\\rm V}=1\\) and the second with \\(N_{\\rm V}\\geq 2\\). The \\(H_{\\rm T}\\) spectra in the two subcategories are then used to search for a signal excess over the predicted background.",
        "Figure 1: Unit-normalized distributions of the 12 variables used in the BDT discriminant. The background contribution (\\(\\bar{t}\\) combined with \\(W+\\rm jets\\)) is shown with a dark blue solid line, while signal distributions are shown for 700 and 800 GeV VLQ \\(B\\) with \\(\\text{BR}(B\\to Wt)=100\\%\\) with red dashed and light blue dotted lines, respectively. The following selection requirements, which define the signal region for the BDT analysis, are applied: \\(N_{\\rm jets}\\geq 6\\), \\(N_{\\rm bjets}\\geq 1\\), \\(N_{\\rm V}\\geq 1\\), and \\(H_{\\rm T}>500\\) GeV."

        "The preselected data sample is divided into a set of mutually exclusive subsamples: the signal region (SR) is used to perform the final search, while five control regions (CRs) are used to validate the background determination. As shown in Table 1, the variables used to define the various regions are the total jet multiplicity (\\(N_{\\rm jets}\\)), the number of hadronic \\(W/Z\\) candidates (\\(N_{\\rm V}\\)), the number of \\(b\\)-tagged jets (\\(N_{\\rm bjets}\\)), and the value of \\(H_{\\rm T}\\) in the event. The control region definitions ensure negligible signal contamination of the control region samples. For example, the predicted contributions from a benchmark signal with a VLQ \\(B\\) mass of 700 GeV are below 0.2% in all control regions.",

The definitions of the various CRs used to validate the background determination are also included. Control regions WCR1 and WCR2 are dominated by \\(W+\\rm jets\\) events, while TCR1, TCR2, and TCR3 are dominated by \\(\\tilde{t}\\) events. A dash in the \\(N_{\\rm V}\\) column means that no requirement is applied on that variable. A dash in the \\(H_{\\rm T}\\) column means that no additional \\(H_{\\rm T}\\) selection is made, apart from the \\(H_{\\rm T}>300\\) GeV requirement applied as part of the event preselection.",
        "As a cross-check of the BDT analysis results, a cut-based approach is used. As shown in Table 1, the signal region for the cuts-based analysis is almost identical to that of the BDT analysis: in addition to the preselection procedure described in Sec. V, the requirements that \\(N_{\\rm jets}\\geq 6\\), \\(N_{\\rm V}\\geq 1\\), and \\(N_{\\rm bjess}\\geq 1\\) are applied. As mentioned earlier, given the lower sensitivity of the cuts-based approach, a more restrictive requirement is made on \\(H_{\\rm T}\\), namely \\(H_{\\rm T}>800\\) GeV, for the cuts-based signal region definition. Given the sizable background, particularly from \\(t\\bar{t}\\) events, that passes these requirements, simply comparing the total number of events in the signal region with the number expected from background processes would not be very sensitive. Instead, the cuts-based analysis exploits the fact that signal events tend to have higher values of \\(H_{\\rm T}\\) and \\(N_{\\rm V}\\) than do background events, as shown in Fig. 1. The cuts-based SR data are divided into two exclusive subcategories, one with \\(N_{\\rm V}=1\\) and the second with \\(N_{\\rm V}\\geq 2\\). The \\(H_{\\rm T}\\) spectra in the two subcategories are then used to search for a signal excess over the predicted background.",

Independent MC samples are used for the different \\(m_{\\rm top}\\) mass points, and from those samples templates with different values of JSF and bJSF are extracted by appropriately scaling the four-momentum of the jets in each sample. The input value for the JSF is applied to all jets, whilst the input value for the bJSF is applied to all \\(b\\)-jets according to the information about the generated quark flavour. This scaling is performed after the various correction steps of the jet calibration and before any event selection.

Their effects on the \\(\\ell\\)+jets and dilepton measurements are listed in Table 3, together with the result of the combination of the two channels discussed in Sect. 8. Each source of uncertainty considered is investigated, when possible, by varying the relevant quantities by \\(\\pm 1\\sigma\\) with respect to their default values.

The difference of the average \\(m_{\\text{top}}\\) computed from pseudo-experiments based on the standard MC sample, and the varied sample under consideration, both evaluated with the original template parameterisations, is used to determine the corresponding uncertainty.

The points show the estimated size of the uncertainties, and the error bars represent the statistical uncertainties on the estimates. Some uncertainty sources in Table 3, such as the uncertainty related to the choice of MC generator for signal events, contain only a single component. For these type of sources, the correlation is either \\(\\rho=+1\\) (red points) or \\(\\rho=-1\\) (blue points). The size of the uncertainty bars in Fig. 6a indicates that the distinction between \\(\\rho=+1\\) and \\(\\rho=-1\\) can be unambiguously made for all components that significantly contribute to the systematic uncertainty on \\(m_{\\rm top}\\).",
        "For uncertainty sources that contain multiple components such as the JES uncertainty described in Appendix A, the correlations given in Table 3 differ from \\(\\rho=\\pm 1\\).

        "The JES is derived using information from test-beam data, LHC collision data, and simulation. The relative JES uncertainty varies from about 1 % to 3 % depending on jet \\(p_{\\rm T}\\) and \\(\\eta\\) as given in Ref. [58]. Since the estimation of the jet energy scale involves a number of steps, the JES uncertainty has various components originating from the calibration method, the calorimeter response, the detector simulation, and the specific choice of parameters in the physics model employed in the MC event generator. The total uncertainty is expressed in terms of 21 \\(p_{\\rm T}\\)- and \\(\\eta\\)-dependent components which are considered uncorrelated [58]. The uncertainties for the individual components and their sum are given in Table 4 in Appendix A. Despite the simultaneous fit of \\(m_{\\rm top}\\), JSF and bJSF in the \\(t\\bar{t}\\to\\) lepton+jets channel there is a non-negligible residual JES uncertainty. This is introduced by the variation of the jet energy scale corrections and their uncertainties with jet kinematics, which cannot be fully captured by global scale factors (JSF, bJSF).

        "The impacts \\(\\delta m_{H}\\) due to each of the considered effects are listed in Table 1. The results are reported for the four individual channels, both for the data and (in parentheses) the prefit Asimov data set. The row labeled \"Systematic uncertainty (sum in quadrature)\" shows the total sums in quadrature of the individual terms in the table. The row labeled \"Systematic uncertainty (nominal)\" shows the corresponding total systematic uncertainties derived using the subtraction in quadrature method discussed in connection with Eq. (3). The two methods to evaluate the total systematic uncertainty are seen to agree within 10 MeV, which is comparable with the precision of the estimates. The two rightmost columns of Table 1 list the contribution of each group of nuisance parameters to the uncertainties in the combined mass measurement, for ATLAS and CMS separately.",
        "The statistical and total uncertainties are summarized in the bottom section of Table 1. Since the weight of a channel in the final combination is determined by the inverse of the squared uncertainty, the approximate relative weights for the combined result are 19% (\\(H\\to\\gamma\\gamma\\)) and 18% (\\(H\\to ZZ\\to 4\\ell\\)) for ATLAS, and 40% (\\(H\\to\\gamma\\gamma\\)) and 23% (\\(H\\to ZZ\\to 4\\ell\\)) for CMS. These weights are reported in the last row of Table 1, along with the expected values.",
        "Figure 3 presents the impact of each group of nuisance parameters on the total systematic uncertainty in the mass measurement of ATLAS, CMS, and the combination. For the individual ATLAS and CMS measurements, the results in Fig. 3 are approximately equivalent to the sum in quadrature of the respective \\(\\delta m_{H}\\) terms in Table 1 multiplied by their analysis weights, after normalizing these weights to correspond to either ATLAS only or CMS only. The ATLAS and CMS combined results in Fig. 3 are the sum in quadrature of the combined results in Table 1.",
        "The results in Table 1 and Fig. 3 establish that the largest systematic effects for the mass uncertainty are those related to the determination of the energy scale of the photons, followed by those associated with the determination of the electron and muon momentum scales. Since the CMS \\(H\\to\\gamma\\gamma\\) channel has the largest weight in the combination, its impact on the systematic uncertainty of the combined result is largest.",

The numbers in parentheses indicate expected values obtained from the prefit Asimov data set discussed in the text. The uncertainties for the combined result are related to the values of the individual channels through the relative weight of the individual channel in the combination, which is proportional to the inverse of the respective uncertainty squared.

        "Although the background estimate only relies on data, the validity of the assumption that the fit in the control region can be used to estimate the background in the signal region was tested using PYTHIA 8, Herwig++, and ALPGEN MC simulated events. Since the multi-jet SM simulated events do not contain a signal, the results of the fit to the entire \\(H_{\\rm T}\\) distribution can be compared to the results of the fit to only the control region and extrapolating into the signal region. As an example, the results for PYTHIA 8 dijet simulated events is shown in figure 2. These studies show that the fit extrapolation approximates the MC simulated events in the signal region to within 20%. This difference is covered by the uncertainties, which are described in the next section.",
