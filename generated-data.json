            "The results of the combination are compatible with the predictions from the SM backgrounds across the tested \\(m_{X}\\) range from 251 to 5. Figure 1(a) shows the local \\(p\\)-value as a function of \\(m_{X}\\) for a narrow resonance that decays into a pair of SM Higgs bosons whose decay branching ratios are predicted under \\(m_{h}=125\\,\\mathrm{GeV}\\). The largest deviation is observed at 1.1 and corresponds to a local significance of 3.3 \\(\\sigma\\), which corresponds to a global significance of 2.1 \\(\\sigma\\) when the trial factor is taken into account [43]. Figure 1(b) shows the upper limits at the 95% confidence level (CL) on the resonant \\(hh\\) production cross section as a function of \\(m_{X}\\), assuming that \\(h\\) is the SM Higgs boson. The observed (expected) upper limits are in the range 0.96-600 fb (1.2-390 fb), depending on \\(m_{X}\\). The \\(b\\bar{b}\\gamma\\gamma\\) search is the most sensitive at low mass, the \\(b\\bar{b}\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}\\) search is the most sensitive in the 400-800  range, and the \\(b\\bar{b}b\\bar{b}\\) search dominates for high resonant masses, demonstrating the complementarity of these three searches. These results represent an improvement in the upper limits by a factor between two and five, depending on \\(m_{X}\\), relative to the previous ATLAS combination [13].\n",

            "The 2HDM is an extension of the SM with an additional Higgs doublet, leading to five Higgs bosons after electroweak symmetry breaking, three neutral and two charged. The neutral Higgs bosons, assuming charge-parity (CP) conservation, can be CP-even (\\(h\\) and \\(H\\), with \\(m_{H}>m_{h}\\)) or CP-odd (\\(A\\)). The resonant \\(hh\\) production is assumed to come from \\(H\\to hh\\) for this interpretation. The \\(h\\) boson is assumed to be the Higgs boson observed at the LHC with \\(m_{h}=125\\GeV\\). The other Higgs bosons (\\(H\\), \\(A\\), \\(H^{\\pm}\\)) are assumed to be mass degenerate, i.e., \\(m_{H}=m_{A}=m_{H\\pm}\\), and the Higgs potential parameter \\(m_{12}^{2}\\) is fixed to \\(m_{A}^{2}\\tan\\beta/(1+\\tan^{2}\\beta)\\), where \\(\\tan\\beta\\) is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets. No constraint is imposed on \\(\\cos(\\beta-\\alpha)\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is the mixing angle between the CP-even Higgs bosons. It, along with \\(\\tan\\beta\\) and \\(m_{H}\\), is taken as a free parameter. Widths and branching ratios are calculated using the 2HDMC program [50]. The \\(H\\) boson gluon-gluon fusion production cross section calculation uses the SusHi package [51; 52], which includes corrections up to next-to-next-to-leading order in \\(\\alpha_{s}\\)[53; 54; 55], massive quarks [56; 57] and electroweak corrections by light fermions [58; 59]. The procedure for the theoretical calculations follows Ref. [60]. The upper limits on the Higgs boson pair production cross section are interpreted as constraints on two benchmark planes: \\(m_{H}\\)-\\(\\tan\\beta\\) for given \\(\\cos(\\beta-\\alpha)\\) values, shown in Figures 2(a)-2(b), and \\(\\cos(\\beta-\\alpha)\\)-\\(m_{H}\\) for fixed \\(\\tan\\beta\\) values, shown in Figures 2(c)-2(d). The interpretation is given in the Type-I 2HDM in which gluon-gluon fusion is the dominant production mechanism throughout the parameter space where the searches have sensitivity. The \\(H\\) boson has a finite natural width in the 2HDM. This is taken into account by considering in the combination only channels for which the experimental mass resolution is large in comparison to the \\(H\\) boson natural width. In particular, the \\(b\\bar{b}\\gamma\\gamma\\) (\\(b\\bar{b}b\\bar{b}\\) and \\(b\\bar{b}\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}\\)) channel upper limits are valid for \\(H\\) boson natural widths \\(\\Gamma_{H}/m_{H}\\) up to 2% (5%). The results are sensitive to \\(\\cos(\\beta-\\alpha)\\) values that are not probed by the SM Higgs boson coupling measurements [61]. For example, the point \\(\\tan\\beta=10\\), \\(\\cos(\\beta-\\alpha)=-0.1\\) is excluded at 95% CL for \\(m_{H}\\) values in the range 270-810, a region allowed by Higgs boson coupling measurements.\n",
            "Figure 2: Exclusion limits at the 95% CL on the Type-I 2HDM parameter space. Observed and expected limits for the combination of all channels and expected limits for each of the individual channels are presented. The 2HDM parameters are shown in the \\(m_{H}\\)–\\(\\tan\\beta\\) plane for (a) \\(\\cos(\\beta-\\alpha)=-0.1\\) and (b) \\(\\cos(\\beta-\\alpha)=0.1\\), and in the \\(\\cos(\\beta-\\alpha)\\)–\\(m_{H}\\) plane for (c) \\(\\tan\\beta=1\\) and (d) \\(\\tan\\beta=10\\). The \\(b\\bar{b}\\gamma\\gamma\\) channel limits are valid for \\(H\\) boson natural widths \\(\\Gamma_{H}/m_{H}<2\\%\\), so limits from this channel are quoted for the parameter space that satisfies this requirement. The limits in the \\(b\\bar{b}b\\bar{b}\\) and \\(b\\bar{b}\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}\\) channels are only valid for \\(\\Gamma_{H}/\\mathrm{m}_{H}<5\\%\\), so no limits are quoted in the dark shaded regions, where the width exceeds this value.\n"
