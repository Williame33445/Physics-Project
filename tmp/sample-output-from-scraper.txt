Legend = Figure 11:Observed and expected 95% CL upper limits, obtained with the BDT analysis, on the cross section for  T5/3 pair production, as a function of T5/3 mass. The colored, charge 5/3 exotic fermion is assumed to decay into a same-sign W boson and top quark, via T5/3 → Wt. The uncertainty on the theoretical cross section is indicated by the width of the theory band.

The definitions of the various control regions (CR) used to validate the background determination are also included. A dash in the N V  column means that no requirement is applied on that variable. A dash in the HT  column means that no additional HT  selection is made, apart from the HT > 300 GeV requirement applied as part of the event preselection.
