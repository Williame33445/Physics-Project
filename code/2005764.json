Shown are the data (dots),  SM predictions (solid lines) with uncertainties, and predictions for a benchmark theory of new contact interactions with a left-chiral color-singlet coupling with constructive (dotted, \u03b7LL=-1 and \u039b=12 TeV) or destructive (dashed, \u03b7LL=+1 and \u039b=8 TeV) interference with the SM processes. Also shown is the impact of the electroweak (EW) corrections described in the text. The error bars on data represent the experimental and statistical uncertainties added in quadrature, with a tick representing experimental uncertainties only. The theoretical uncertainties are displayed as a shaded band around the SM prediction.",
